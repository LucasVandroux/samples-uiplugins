Docker plugin
-------------------

This plugin allows to create an oVirt VM that runs a docker image inside it.
Requirements:
1. The template that has a docker, cloud-init, and oVirt-guest agent installed
2. The docker service should be configured with the "-r" option, to make sure the docker container is restarted after rebooting the VM

INSTALLING

1. Configure oVirt Engine HTTP(S) origin(s), and the available docker images, either via editing the existing plugin config file ($PLUGIN_HOME/docker.json), or by creating a new user plugin config file in $ENGINE_ETC/ui-plugins/docker-config.json
- The current config file has some docker images configured, as well as the "localhost" origin

Expose plugin metadata to oVirt Engine
  $ ln -s $PLUGIN_HOME/docker.json $ENGINE_USR/ui-plugins/docker.json

Expose plugin static files to oVirt Engine
  $ ln -s $PLUGIN_HOME/docker-resources $ENGINE_USR/ui-plugins/docker-resources

USAGE:
1. Fill in the DC, Cluster, Template (template that has the requirements above), VM properties, Docker details (image, port mapping and command if needed), and cloud-init data.
2. Run the created VM

Notes:
1. If the docker image already exists in the template then the docker container will probably be started quickly.
However, if it isn't then it will be downloaded from the docker public registry, and that may take a while, depnding on the size of the image.
2. The list of containers is currently hard-coded in the plugin configuration file. The code to get the list from the external public docker image repository is available, but it requires JSONP support to prevent cross-origin issues.
